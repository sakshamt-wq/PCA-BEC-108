HEAD PCA on Gene Expression Data  Overview In this project, we explore how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can help us understand patterns in gene expression data, specifically for breast cancer patients.

Instead of just looking at thousands of genes individually, PCA helps reduce the complexity and lets us visualize meaningful patterns in a simpler way.

Objective The main goals of this project were:

Extract expression levels of two important genes: XBP1 and GATA3

Visualize their relationship using a scatter plot

Apply PCA to reduce dimensions

Project the data onto the first principal component (PC1)

Dataset We used gene expression data from 105 patients, organized into:

class.tsv → Labels (ER+ or ER-)

filtered.tsv.gz → Gene expression values

columns.tsv.gz → Mapping of gene IDs to gene names What I Did

Data Processing Loaded all datasets using Python
Identified the gene IDs for XBP1 and GATA3

Extracted their expression values for all patients

Visualization Created a scatter plot of XBP1 vs GATA3
Colored points based on cancer type (ER+ / ER-)

This helps visually see if the two groups separate

PCA Implementation Applied PCA on the dataset
Reduced high-dimensional data to 1 principal component (PC1)

Projected samples onto PC1

This shows how well PCA separates the classes

Results The scatter plot shows a clear pattern between the two gene expressions

PCA projection highlights separation between ER+ and ER- samples

Even though data is high-dimensional, PCA captures important variation effectively

Overview
This repository contains code and data for running principal component analysis (PCA) on a small gene expression dataset. The goal is to demonstrate dimensionality reduction and basic visualizations (scatter plots, PCA projections).
